\noindent Dear Ms. Mac Donald, \\

Several colleagues and I have been thinking about the increase in nationwide crime rates. We have enjoyed reading your articles on the subject. In the case of Chicago, we believe that there is a different version of the Ferguson Effect occurring than the one you wrote about in your January 26th article \textit{In Chicago, `the Feds' Are Part of the Problem}. \\

You attribute the decline in pedestrian stops and narcotics arrests to declining police morale which in turn is caused by media scrutiny and the Obama Administration's hostile attitude towards proactive policing. However, a general decline in police morale does not take into account the suddenness of the decline in police stops. The number of police stops fell enormously in the single month between December of 2015 and January of 2016. In order for this decline to be due to changes in police morale, there must have been some catastrophic media event in January that devastated the morale of the CPD and that has kept their morale down since then. \\

A theory that fits better with the data is that the CPD's policies towards how street stops are evaluated changed in a way disincentived officers from making stops. On January 1st of 2016, police officers switched from filling out notecard sized contact cards to filling out 2.5 page long investigative stop reports. Furthermore, these investigative stop reports are reviewed by the ACLU and by an independent consultant. If we graph the number of police stops in Chicago and the number of possession-related drug arrests, we see that both plummet as soon as the policy is implemented.

This theory fits well with the themes of your previous work. The CPD's policy was adopted due to federal scrutiny, criticism by the media, and threats of lawsuits by the ACLU. We would be happy to hear any thoughts you have on the subject. \\

Best regards, \\

Reuben Bauer
